```{r}
# Load libraries
library(ISLR)
library(car)
library(leaps)
library(glmnet)

# We'll work with the "Hitters" data frame.
head(Hitters)

# Bonus: How many entries of Hitters$Salary are NA?
# Hint: There are multiple ways to find this. Try using, e.g., summary()

# Remove these rows using na.omit()

```

# Question 1
```{r}
# Fit a model lm.reduced predicting Salary in terms of AtBat, Hits, and Walks. 


# Inspect the modelâ€™s variance inflation factors using vif().
# Do you observe any issues? Support your position with plots and correlation estimates.

```

# Question 2
```{r}
# Copy the data frame as Hitters.copy and add a column Avg = Hits / AtBat:
Hitters.copy = Hitters
# Hitters.copy$Avg = 

# Repeat Q1 using your new data frame, Hitters.copy,
# replacing AtBats and Hits with Avg. What happens to the VIFs?

```

# Question 3
```{r}
# Now forget Hitters.copy and continue using Hitters.
# Use regsubsets() to fit a predictive model for Salary in terms of all other variables.Save the model summary as reg.summary.

```

# Question 4
```{r}
# Using your reg.summary object, rank which variables are most important for predicting salary. If you were trying to make the most interpretable (i.e. small) model, which predictors would you include?

```

# Question 5
```{r}
# Define two variables
# * y is Hitters$Salary
# * X is a model.matrix() for Salary in terms of all other variables.

# y = Hitters$Salary
# X = model.matrix()

# Using glmnet(), fit a model with alpha=0 and lambda=0. 
# Then fit another model using the usual lm(). How do they compare?

```

# Question 6
```{r}
# Using the glmnet() function, fit ridge regression models with parameter
# lambda = 1, 10, 100, 1000. What happens to the coefficients as lambda increases?

```

# Question 7
```{r}
# Repeat Q6 with LASSO regression models (alpha=1).

```
