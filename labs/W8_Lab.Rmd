# Consider the data set Smarket
# Prelim: How many observations per year are there?
# Hint: Try using table()

# table()

# 1. Fit a logistic regression model glm.fit predicting (log-odds) Smarket$Direction each day in terms of all other variables except Today. Which ones significantly predict the stock market direction?

# glm.fit = glm()
# summary(glm.fit)

# 2. From your model, make a vector glm.probs representing the probability that the direction will be Up each day. 

# glm.probs = predict()

# What is the average probability? Does that suggest anything about the data/model?

# 3. Using a classification threshold of 0.5 (i.e. if predicted probability is >= .5, then predicted class is Up) and ifelse(), make a vector of predictions on whether the market will go Up or Down each day, glm.preds. 

# glm.preds = ifelse()

# 4. Make a confusion matrix comparing the true values Smarket$Direction against the predictions glm.preds. What is the error rate, sensitivity and specificity?

# conf.matrix = table()

# Repeat Q3-4 with a classification threshold of 0.45 and 0.6. How do your fit statistics change? Which of the three thresholds would you choose?
